#Simple hub for WebRTC signaling#

## Why? ##

I had to do a spiking about WebRTC signaling for a project.

## What? ##

A websocket server that connects 2 users through to transmit WebRTC offers, answers and ICE candidates.

## How? ##

Obviously NodeJS with SockJS to handle websocket connections.
